## **Instructions on how to interact with the work**
1. **Loading page**
Open your browser and navigate to the page containing the code via Live Sever. Please wait for the page to fully load, at which point you will see my work.

2. **Using Keyboard Interaction**
- Pressing the Up Arrow key moves the center of the canvas up.
- Pressing the Down Arrow key moves the center of the canvas down.
- Pressing the Left Arrow key moves the center of the canvas to the left.
- Pressing the Right Arrow key moves the center of the canvas to the right.
- After releasing any arrow key, the center of the canvas will stop moving.

3. **Using Mouse Interaction**
Mouse Click: Click anywhere on the canvas to generate fireworks. Each click will create a set of random color fireworks at the clicked position, which will fall in the direction of gravity, simulating the real fireworks explosion effect.

## **Details of my individual approach to animating the group code**
1. The elements of interaction and time are used. With mouse clicks, the user can generate fireworks effects on the canvas, with each click creating a new fireworks object. Using the keyboard, the user can control the position of the center of the canvas by pressing or releasing the arrow keys to change the visual effect. In addition, the code also uses countdown and gravity to simulate the fireworks effect. Each fireworks object has a countdown attribute, which will explode at the end of the countdown, generating more particles, which are gradually falling under the influence of gravity, creating a dynamic visual effect.


2. In my work, the following main image properties are animated:

**Fireworks effect**: When the user clicks on the canvas, a fireworks effect is generated. These fireworks particles will explode in the air to form multiple particles of random colors and gradually fall down under the influence of gravity. This dynamic fireworks effect is realized by the movement of particles and gravity simulation, which makes the screen vibrant and changing.

**Canvas Center Position**: By pressing and releasing the arrow keys, users can control the position of the canvas center. When the arrow keys are pressed, the center of the canvas will move in the corresponding direction, and when the arrow keys are released, the center of the canvas will stop moving. This movement effect allows the user to adjust the visual center of the screen in real time.

**Color change**: The color of the firework particles is random, and the color of the particles generated by each explosion will be different, which increases the diversity and interest of the visual effect.

3. My inspiration is as follows:
![Fall](Fall.jpg)

The piece we chose to restore was 'Apple Tree'. I was initially inspired by the theme of celebrating the fall harvest, so I collected many images of fall, including golden leaves, harvest fruits and other elements. In my country, fireworks are often set off for major celebrations, such as the Chinese New Year. For farmers, the harvest is the most joyful time, so I decided to use fireworks as the primary visual element to show the joy of the harvest and the atmosphere of celebration.

In this work, I aim to create an atmosphere of joy and harvest through dynamic fireworks effects and autumn colors. The fireworks in the picture not only symbolize the warm atmosphere of the celebration but also express gratitude for the harvest and the expectations for the future. Each mouse click generates fireworks on the canvas, which will bloom in the air and form colorful particles, as if the fruits of the harvest are flying in the air, symbolizing the joy of the harvest and good wishes for the future.

Through this design, I want the joy of the harvest and let the audience feel the immersive atmosphere of celebration. Each interaction is full of surprise and anticipation, just like the endless hope and joy that the harvest season brings. Through the combination of fireworks and fall elements, my work highlights the theme of harvest and the hope for life and the future.

4. The parts of my code that primarily animate the image include the fireworks effect and the movement of the center of the canvas. I made larger changes to increase interactivity and dynamic effects than the initial group code. By making these improvements, my code added richer dynamic effects and user interactivity, making the work visually more vivid and distinctly different from the work of other group members. While other group members' work may focus on color changes or component resizing of static images, my work enhances the overall interactive experience and visual impact through fireworks effects and dynamic changes in canvas position.

- **Major Changes and Animated Properties**
   - Differentiating from our group's WORK, I added a fireworks effect that generates fireworks when the user clicks on the canvas. Each firework object will explode in the air, generating multiple particles that will change color randomly and gradually fall under gravity, simulating the natural firework effect.

   - In our work, the position of the image on the canvas is fixed, and there is no movement effect. In my personal work, I added the ability to control the center of the canvas using the arrow keys. When the user presses the arrow keys, the center of the canvas will move in the corresponding direction, making the image more dynamic and interactive.

- **The specific implementation of animation**
   - In the mousePressed function, each click creates a new Firework object and adds it to the particle array. The fireworks object explodes at the end of the countdown, generating more particles, which move according to gravity and speed and gradually disappear.

   - In the keyPressed and keyReleased functions, the position of the center of the canvas is moved by updating the values of moveX and moveY by pressing and releasing the arrow keys. In the draw function, the position of the center of the canvas is updated in real time according to the values of moveX and moveY.

- I borrowed from a piece on [Happy Coding](https://happycoding.io/tutorials/p5js/creating-classes/fireworks)to create my fireworks effect. This work details how to make a fireworks effect using p5.js and manages particle generation and animation by creating classes.

    - **Technical explanation**
        - **Creating Classes**:
            The author created a Particle class to define the properties and behavior of particles. Each particle has properties such as position, velocity, color and size, and a step method for updating the position and state of the particle. I have also created a Particle class in my code that defines the properties of the particles and uses the step method to update the position of the particles so that they fall under the influence of gravity.

         - **Fireworks explosion effect**:
            The fireworks in this work are realized by creating a fireworks class inherited from the particle class. The Firework class contains a countdown timer, and when the countdown is over, the fireworks explode, generating more particles. In my code, I have also created a fireworks class that uses the countdown mechanism to control the fireworks explosion and generate multiple particles. These particles will be randomly distributed in the air and gradually fall to simulate the real fireworks effect.

        - **Animation update and drawing**:
            The draw function is used in this work to constantly update and draw the position and state of the particles. The step method of the particle is called every frame to update its position, and the draw method is called to draw the particle. I have implemented similar logic in my code to constantly update the position of the particles and draw them in the draw function. It makes the fireworks effect dynamic and continuous.

        - **Reasons for use**
            I chose this technique because it provides a structured and efficient way to manage particle generation and animation effects. In addition, this method also makes the fireworks effect more realistic and vivid, in line with the theme of celebrating the harvest in my work.
